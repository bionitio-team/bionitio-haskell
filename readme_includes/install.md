We recommend using the `stack` tool to install bionitio. You will need to install `stack` on your system first.

On OS X this can be can with homebrew like so (you may need to run `brew update` first):

```
% brew install stack
```

Once you have `stack` installed you can use it to build bionitio like so:

```
% stack install
```
